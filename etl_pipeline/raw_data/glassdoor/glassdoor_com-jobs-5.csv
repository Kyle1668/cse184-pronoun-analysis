Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit-sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new MacBook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultant's pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka, and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Cloud-based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies mean having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you."

Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit-sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new MacBook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultant's pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.


We are only considering local Omaha-based candidates.

Qualifications
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka, and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.
JVM languages such as Java, Groovy, Scala, and Clojure.
Relational database technologies such as MySQL, Postgres, and Oracle.
NoSQL technologies such as Cassandra, DynamoDb, MongoDB and ElasticSearch.
Messaging technologies such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ and Amazon SQS.
Build tools such as Gradle and Maven.
Experience with microservice metrics, monitoring, and logging.
Experience with NodeJS services (Express, hapi, Koa, Serverless).
Cloud-based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies mean having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you."

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

How We Grow

We're almost always hiring Software Developers on all our teams across CoverMyMeds. We encourage internal movement, grow constantly and experience a ton of change, so we feel it's most important to assess you for how you'll succeed at CoverMyMeds versus on one individual team. We do our best to learn as much as we can about your skill set and interests, and at the end of our process, we select which teams we feel will set you up for success right away.

Our process:
Phone interview with one of our Recruiters
One of our Recruiters will set up a phone call with you that typically lasts around 45 minutes. They'll start by answering any questions you have about CoverMyMeds to ensure you get what you need out of the chat. This interview is meant to be conversational and will adapt, based on your skill set and interests. Our Recruiter will introduce topics that are important to our development teams and you'll share what experience and opinions you have in those areas. Topics may include things like security, reliability, REST, teaching others, learning new skills, our core values, etc.
Live coding interview with one of our Software Developers
One of our Software Developers will join you for a video and screen share meeting that typically lasts around 1.5 hours. They will send you 3 different coding exercises to walk through different areas of the stack. The first coding exercise will be client-side, the second will be backend and the third will be a few SQL operations. They will spend 30 minutes live on each exercise with you. For any work you two decide should be finished up after that 30 minutes, you'll have the opportunity to complete it on your own time and send it back to them. We'd like you to approach this meeting as if you're mentoring our Software Developer. We encourage you to explain your approach, be collaborative and ask questions. The goal of taking you through different parts of the stack is to confirm your areas of strength and passion. We also like to see fluency with your chosen tools. It's totally expected for you to use search engines while you're problem-solving, we just ask that you're mindful of how much you're relying on them. You'll be working through the exercises on your own machine, using the tools of your choice.
Code day with one of our development hiring teams
Our code day is meant to be a day in the life of our Software Developer role. You'll join us for the day, work with our team and build an application. You'll simulate a mini sprint by planning a project with a Software Developer, Database Administrator, Product Manager and Engineering Manager. You'll have a combination of individual work time and pair programming with a Software Developer. At the end of the day, you'll demo your application and dig into the code. You'll have tons of opportunities to ask us questions and really learn what it'd be like to work at CoverMyMeds. We're happy to conduct this step virtually for our remote candidates to get a good sense for how a remote Software Developer role would feel.
A quick note: If you'd prefer different logistics to accommodate your individual needs and set you up for success, let us know how we can help and we'll do our best. We want this process to be as accessible and inclusive as possible for you.

3.0","As a Flight Controls Software Engineer, your role will be to design and implement flight control, estimation, and simulation software for an unconventional autonomous vehicle. You will be involved in all stages of development — from dynamic modeling and sub-scale testing, to designing complex control systems, and validating software and models in simulation and on full-scale aircraft.
You have an in-depth understanding of fixed-wing and rotorcraft flight dynamics, and of classical and modern flight control techniques. You have designed, implemented, and tested flight and mission control architectures, and successfully deployed them in autonomous vehicles. You have built high-fidelity simulations for software-in-the-loop and hardware-in-the-loop testing. You probably have a passion for airplanes, robots, or both!
You have a strong mathematical and engineering background. You are experienced in model-based design techniques, and deploying them within the constraints of safety-critical embedded systems. You have extensive experience with development and analysis tools in MATLAB and Simulink. You are a competent software engineer, experienced with application level software deployment, testing, debugging. You are experienced in C and C++, with a clear understanding of what happens on a hardware level. You have composed software systems with components developed in multiple languages. You can walk anyone in your organization through your systems’ code. You squash the bugs that perplex others.
As our projects are “out-of-the-box” by design, you will be expected to seek, investigate, and implement creative solutions to challenges and impediments, and skillfully pivot when needed, with minimum loss of momentum. We expect you to do this with equal parts technical intuition and rigorous by-the-book protocol.
To get specific, your responsibilities will be to:
Design and implement flight control, estimation, and simulation software for an autonomous unconventional aircraft.
