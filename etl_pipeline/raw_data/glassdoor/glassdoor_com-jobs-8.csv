At Cogo Labs we build reliable, scalable, and customizable tool chains that allow our businesses to find and attract users who will become loyal customers. We are hiring a Software Engineer to contribute directly to critical growth initiatives and key systems that support our internal and external customers in our quest to build massive scale consumer internet companies. You'll work on cross-functional teams not only with different engineering disciplines, but from across the company to drive success under the direction of Project Owners, with mentors to guide you in your career development. Ownership and accountability are core to how we build successful teams and as a Software Engineer at Cogo you will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as we continue building some of Boston's fastest growing startups.

How we work:

Our core systems are written in Go, containerized using Docker, and managed using Kubernetes; we are obsessive about using Git to track not only our code, but also manage projects, prioritize user requests, and keep our work transparent across the company, all the way down to planning speakers for our various monthly meetings. We run our own state of the art compute and storage systems, managed by our Sysops team, and meshed with cloud services for maximum efficiency and flexibility. We favor Kafka for queuing solutions, high availability MySQL and ElasticSearch clusters for database needs, and Airflow for job and data pipeline orchestration. On the cloud side we make extensive use of Redshift, S3, Presto, and EMR services.

We are big believers in sharing knowledge & expertise internally, with code reviews as standard practice and monthly engineering-focused meetings where we share learnings and best practices. Tech conferences such as DockerCon and GopherCon help us make sure we're leveraging the best the community has to offer, and our engineering teams love sharing and applying new developments that can accelerate growth.

On your first day you should expect to:
Be up and running on GitHub, TravisCI, Codecov, Sentry, and Docker
Start looking at an existing code base and sketching out a plan of attack for your project
Begin learn about how our business works to add context to your day to day work
Going forward, expect to:
Add new features to tools and services that support businesses under incubation
Streamline existing processes that are painful or time consuming
Upgrade existing systems to take advantage of new technologies
Support analysts who use your tools in production workflows
Build monitoring infrastructure that makes sure systems and campaigns are running smoothly
Maintain and improve existing libraries, APIs, and services that analyst teams and incubating companies depend on daily to grow their businesses
Things that would help you succeed in this role:
BA/BS in Computer Science required

Familiarity with SQL and database design
Working knowledge of HTML, Javascript and CSS.
Experience working with macOS or Linux development tools
A desire to work with and solve problems related to the warehousing of large data sets

Our work is challenging and dynamic; our environment is fun and supportive
Our company is profitable and established - ""startup culture"" without ""startup anxiety""
We offer competitive salaries and benefits, along with substantive participation in the success of the companies we incubate
The Cogo team is an interesting and diverse group with passions and hobbies outside of work - we are musicians, athletes, filmmakers, gamers, authors, beer brewers, and whatever you are!"

You'll step into a supportive environment praised by our engineers for its focus on continuous learning.

Here’s how our engineering culture will support your career growth:


Pair Programming

– Paulette Luftig, Software Engineer

Full-stack development
“We have open architecture meetings that everyone is invited to, which we can do because everyone is full stack, and we all know how the pieces fit together. There are very few blind spots this way.”
–Maggie Sheldon, Senior Director of Product

As our product and customer base grow, we’re seeing interesting technical challenges. We’ve recently finished:
Moving from Sprockets to Webpack/Yarn
Real-time streaming of all database events to time-sensitive application systems
Automated containerized staging deployment of every green developer build
Upcoming challenges include:

Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit-sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new MacBook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultant's pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.


We are only considering local Omaha-based candidates.

Qualifications
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka, and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.
JVM languages such as Java, Groovy, Scala, and Clojure.
Relational database technologies such as MySQL, Postgres, and Oracle.

Messaging technologies such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ and Amazon SQS.
Build tools such as Gradle and Maven.
Experience with microservice metrics, monitoring, and logging.
Experience with NodeJS services (Express, hapi, Koa, Serverless).
Cloud-based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies mean having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you."
