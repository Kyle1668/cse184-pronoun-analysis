"Software Engineer",,,"About TriplebyteTriplebyte helps companies find and hire great technical talent. For any company building software, this is crucial for success. A recent survey of top C-Level Executives, across multiple industries, showed that software, R&D and recruiting technical talent are the top areas they are planning increased investment and budget over the next 5 years. Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s online technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 40 will double in size during 2019. Now is a great time to join as we're on an exciting growth trajectory. You will have lots of opportunity for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.We have built Machine Learning models that predict the likelihood of an engineer getting an offer from a particular company. Interviewing and assessing engineering talent tends to be noisy, but our technical assessment has proven to be good enough to extract meaningful signals. We collect data on interview results and in-house evaluations, which gives us a unique dataset to play with. We've used that data to deliver a 40% conversion rate on our candidates at interview to offer, compared to the industry standard 20%.Our mission is to create a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently route it to the best place, streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process, while removing human biases that can hold back some candidates.We're an experienced team, the founders have each built and sold companies before. Ammon and Guillaume founded Socialcam (acquired by Autodesk for $60 million) and Harj was the first partner hired at Y Combinator since its founding.Building the best productWe are rapidly growing our engineering team, we are looking for generalist, full-stack, frontend, backend, machine learning, and dev-ops engineers! The Triplebyte engineering team is still rather small, only 8 people. We all went through the Triplebyte process : )We move fast, release new features daily and iterate quickly. Triplebyte is growing very quickly and the engineering team is fully dedicated to supporting that growth, in any way we can.We are a generalist engineering team, we work on anything that helps the company or other teams grow. We cycle through backend, full-stack and frontend work based on the most critical needs. All of us are encouraged to work on all those parts.Our frontend is mostly in React/Redux.Our backend is in Ruby on Rails, Postgres and Redis. (We also use python with Tensorflow for all our data science work)It doesn't seem like it, but we have built a LOT of software. We are a truly full-stack company and we are building a process that needs to be perfect ends to ends. We have software for engineers, for interviewers, for writers, for companies, for us, etc..If that's any indication of scale, we crossed recently the 200 tables in our Postgres database : )Join us and help us build the best product! We value initiative, productivity, and ownership.Compensation and BenefitsCompetitive salary and stock options packageOpen vacation policyEmployer paid health, vision and dental insurance401(k) plan with matchingPre-tax commuter benefitsDaily catered lunchesOur MissionWe believe strongly in building a truly meritocratic, unbiased process for finding great talent. Even the best technology companies today still use where people went to college as a proxy for intelligence and ability. We're building a process that looks only at ability, not credentials, so we can have a future where everyone can focus on just learning and being good at what they do, not how they look on paper.Every aspect of running a company has been improved over the last decade, except hiring. Most decisions are still made using amorphous terms like ""gut feel"" or ""culture fit"". They should be made using crisp data. Only a company specializing on this problem, using data collected from the hiring process at hundreds of companies, can solve it. That's the company we're building. Our mission is creating a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently routing it to the best place.

"Software Engineer","Heap","San Francisco, CA 94104","We're eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day. Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.How we workHappy Customers > Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be ""pure.""Vision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.Writing > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.What we're looking forWe’d particularly like to get to know you if:you communicate with clarity and precision. We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.you're passionate, even if it's not about analytics. There should be something you know more about than anyone on our team.you’ve written 10,000 lines of code that look embarrassing in retrospect. ... and you've written 10,000 lines of good code since then.you like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes. We aren't robots.What we're buildingUnder the hood, Heap is powered by node.js, Scala, Spark, ZooKeeper, Kafka, and CitusDB. Our app-layer stack is TypeScript, React, mobx, Redis, and PostgreSQL.We're working on:Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies. We also support materializing massive retroactive datasets into our customers' cloud data warehouses. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe). All of this has to happen with virtually no performance cost or integration overhead.Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.Our HQ is in SF, and we have an office in New York, but a large part of our engineering team is remote. We cover relocation costs, and can sponsor visas. We'd love to hear from you, no matter where you are!Heap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.People are what make Heap awesome.

"Software Engineer",,,"About TriplebyteTriplebyte helps companies find and hire great technical talent. For any company building software, this is crucial for success. A recent survey of top C-Level Executives, across multiple industries, showed that software, R&D and recruiting technical talent are the top areas they are planning increased investment and budget over the next 5 years. Companies like Apple, Dropbox and American Express trust Triplebyte’s online technical assessment to identify the best engineers for their open roles and reduce the time and effort it takes to hire them.We just raised a $35 million Series B and our team of 40 will double in size during 2019. Now is a great time to join as we're on an exciting growth trajectory. You will have lots of opportunity for taking on responsibility and developing new skills quickly.We have built Machine Learning models that predict the likelihood of an engineer getting an offer from a particular company. Interviewing and assessing engineering talent tends to be noisy, but our technical assessment has proven to be good enough to extract meaningful signals. We collect data on interview results and in-house evaluations, which gives us a unique dataset to play with. We've used that data to deliver a 40% conversion rate on our candidates at interview to offer, compared to the industry standard 20%.Our mission is to create a scientific method for identifying great talent and intelligently route it to the best place, streamlining and speeding up the recruitment process, while removing human biases that can hold back some candidates.We're an experienced team, the founders have each built and sold companies before.

"Engineering Manager",,,"Who we are: Backed by QED Investors, Lendeavor is building the modern bank for healthcare providers to help improve the quality of care they provide to millions of patients nationwide. Healthcare professionals are facing increasing financial pressure and a complex landscape of services that are difficult to navigate. We're committed to empowering these professionals with technology-enabled offerings to make it easier for them to obtain the right financial products and services when they need them so that they can focus on what they do best -- providing outstanding care.Our first step was to make streamlined business financing (for example, a $750,000 loan for a dentist to buy her first practice) available to busy healthcare practitioners at their convenience -- instead of during the typical 9-to-5 banker’s hours.

"Software Engineer, Frontend",,,"Oasis Labs engineers are developing the next-generation of secure and private cloud technologies that change how users share information and interact with one another. Oasis Labs was founded by a team of academic and entrepreneurial leaders from Google, Apple, UCBerkeley, and Tor and backed by a diverse range of investors including a16zcrypto, Accel and Binance.The internet and cloud computing have fundamentally changed our lives, demonstrating the potential of what data at scale can enable. Data has the potential to provide enormous societal value, foster advancements in many industries, and enable entirely new use-cases and applications. Despite these promises, today much of this valuable data remains restricted and siloed due to privacy concerns. Moreover, when data is shared, users have little to no control over how their data is used and too often it’s misused. We believe in empowering users and developers to protect and control their data in order to responsibly enable data-driven applications of the future. Our platform enables privacy preserving and computationally complex applications, giving developers the ability to build applications that protect user data by design.How does a user know they’re secure and in control when using an application? Our Software Engineers are tackling the challenges of bridging the gap between our users and our novel security protocols to put users back in control of their data. Only by helping users understand the way their data is being handled, can we rebuild the trust being threatened by the daily stories of data breaches and misuse.

They bootstrapped the company, funding it with their own money, and have been profitable basically from the start, carving out a small niche in the big, big world of Internet marketing, mainly focused on pay per click (PPC) advertising. While the company has chosen to stay relatively small (19 employees), it's definitely not a struggling startup.Some of the things we bring to the table: · Gourmet, Chef-Prepared Food- We have a legit, professionally trained chef that cooks a gourmet lunch for us every day. Here's a sample lunch menu:· M: Smoked meats day - smoked in our own smoker that our chef runs at her house. Beef ribs, various sausages, bacon, pork loin, beef ribs, probably a vegetable of some sort (gets lost in the shuffle on smoked meats day)· Tu: Flat iron steak, grilled salmon, quinoa, grilled veggies· W: Chicken and shrimp shawarma, grilled broccoli· Th: Pork loin stuffed w/ feta cheese, lentil dahl, rice· F: Prime rib, baked potato, cheesy broccoli· Flexibility- Set your own hours. Want to come in at 11? Not a problem (might even be a slight positive since it'd help with dev coverage later in the day). Need to run an errand? Go to your kid's elementary school program? Not a problem.· Flexible Vacation- As long as you come in and get your job done, we're not going to care how much vacation you take. We decided that we trust our employees and that keeping track of time off was a pain for everyone, so just take what you need.· Other Food and Drinks- In addition to the chef-cooked lunches, we stock the fridges and cupboards with whatever else you want. Currently that means fresh fruit, yogurt, fresh pre-cooked bacon, etc.· Small Company Atmosphere- Not a lot of process overhead (no TPS reports). Lots of leeway on how to accomplish your tasks. Own your projects. We keep project management simple using Trello. Wear your basketball shorts to work if you want (I do). We work hard and are very successful at what we do, but have a great work/life balance.· Great Office- Quiet office space - no call center noise to drown out, and no cubicle farm. Easy access from I-215 near Stephanie St.· Matching 401k- Get a 4% company match when you invest 5% (for a 9% overall investment) - 100% vested immediately - no having to wait years for the company match to vest.· Group Health Insurance· Whatever Hardware/Software Tools You Need- We don't skimp on giving our devs what they need to get the job done:· Brand new computer - we usually get top-end, quiet-running desktops in the $3k+ range, but it's your call· Two 30"" monitors (or three if you want another)· A nice chair - something like an Aeron or Mirra 2 by Herman Miller· Wireless headphones· And whatever else hardware/software-wise you feel like you needJob Type: Full-timeSalary: $70,000.00 to $100,000.00 /yearExperience:ASP.NET/ ASP.NET MVC: 1 year (Preferred)c#: 1 year (Preferred)SQL: 1 year (Preferred)Location:Henderson, NV (Required)Work authorization:United States (Required)Work Location:One locationBenefits:Health insurancePaid time offFlexible scheduleRetirement planThis Company Describes Its Culture as:People-oriented -- supportive and fairness-focusedTeam-oriented -- cooperative and collaborative"

"Product Manager",,,"Creating as a team and growing as a team.At Dama Financial, we’re bringing financial inclusion to an industry that is defining our decade – cannabis. We’ve spent the past 3 years building products that now serve as the building blocks to an entire financial framework for businesses in the underserved cannabis industry.We’re seeking hungry self-starters to join our team of optimistic problem solvers. We believe that success is driven by a combination of passion and curiosity. Together, both fuel rapid innovation, a required component to leading the market with best-in-class offerings. If you identify with our mission and have what it takes to add value to our organization, submit your resume today.An overview of the problem we’re tackling.With limited access to financial services, about 70 percent of all cannabis-related businesses (CRBs) use cash for all their transactions. Cash-intensive operations can pose major threats to public safety, incur high costs to properly manage, and be vulnerable to employee theft. 10 percent of all financial and product loss in the cannabis industry is attributed to external robberies that some businesses attempt to combat with security equipment and armed guards – a costly risk to manage. Even with those safety measures in place, there’s a bigger problem to worry about: employee theft which contributes to about 90% of all loss in the industry.From an efficiency perspective, cash ridden CRBs operate at a fundamental disadvantage. With cannabis sales expected to reach $75 billion by 2030, CRBs need to establish a reliable financial framework to thrive.Viable financial solutions for CRBs exist and are readily available. Dama Financial was founded by entrepreneurs that have a proven track record of successfully leveraging modern technology to provide financial inclusion to historically unbanked categories. During the past 3 years, Dama’s leadership team has turned their focus to addressing the challenges burdening the cannabis industry – the unbanked category of our time.Our unique positioning enables us to deliver.Dama Financial, through its bank partners, provides CRBs with access to transparent and sustainable banking and payment solutions. Using innovative technology, data and artificial intelligence, Dama exceeds the compliance and regulatory requirements for servicing CRBs, bringing legitimacy to the rapidly growing cannabis industry.Dama’s comprehensive and compliant financial framework offers CRBs the option to maintain cashless operations, reducing their exposure to security risks while improving their business efficiencies and operational focus.Experience that would be great to have.Built APIs, products, and complex systems at scaleExperience working on a large-scale platforms or infrastructureA computer science, math, or science degree or software engineering experienceTraits that may indicate you are a fit.You’re a creative product thinker who loves collaborating across the company with engineering, analytics, marketing, design and salesYou have strong written and verbal communication skills with a talent for precise articulations of customer problemsYou have experience managing technical software products from kick-off to shipYou do whatever it takes to make your product and team successful whether that means writing a QA plan or hunting down the root cause of a user’s frustrationBeyond just shipping new products, you obsess about continuous product improvement and can optimize for shipping a portfolio of small, medium and large releasesYou’ve ever started or run a business beforeIt’s a two-way street.

"Software Engineer",,,"We're eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day. Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.How we workHappy Customers > Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be ""pure.""Vision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.Writing > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.What we're looking forWe’d particularly like to get to know you if:you communicate with clarity and precision. We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.you're passionate, even if it's not about analytics. There should be something you know more about than anyone on our team.you’ve written 10,000 lines of code that look embarrassing in retrospect. ... and you've written 10,000 lines of good code since then.you like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes. We aren't robots.What we're buildingUnder the hood, Heap is powered by node.js, Scala, Spark, ZooKeeper, Kafka, and CitusDB. Our app-layer stack is TypeScript, React, mobx, Redis, and PostgreSQL.We're working on:Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies. We also support materializing massive retroactive datasets into our customers' cloud data warehouses. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe). All of this has to happen with virtually no performance cost or integration overhead.Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.Our HQ is in SF, and we have an office in New York, but a large part of our engineering team is remote. We cover relocation costs, and can sponsor visas. We'd love to hear from you, no matter where you are!Heap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.People are what make Heap awesome.
