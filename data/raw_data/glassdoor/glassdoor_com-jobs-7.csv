We are hiring a Software Engineer to contribute directly to critical growth initiatives and key systems that support our internal and external customers in our quest to build massive scale consumer internet companies. You'll work on cross-functional teams not only with different engineering disciplines, but from across the company to drive success under the direction of Project Owners, with mentors to guide you in your career development. Ownership and accountability are core to how we build successful teams and as a Software Engineer at Cogo you will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as we continue building some of Boston's fastest growing startups.

How we work:

Our core systems are written in Go, containerized using Docker, and managed using Kubernetes; we are obsessive about using Git to track not only our code, but also manage projects, prioritize user requests, and keep our work transparent across the company, all the way down to planning speakers for our various monthly meetings. We run our own state of the art compute and storage systems, managed by our Sysops team, and meshed with cloud services for maximum efficiency and flexibility. We favor Kafka for queuing solutions, high availability MySQL and ElasticSearch clusters for database needs, and Airflow for job and data pipeline orchestration. On the cloud side we make extensive use of Redshift, S3, Presto, and EMR services.

We are big believers in sharing knowledge & expertise internally, with code reviews as standard practice and monthly engineering-focused meetings where we share learnings and best practices. Tech conferences such as DockerCon and GopherCon help us make sure we're leveraging the best the community has to offer, and our engineering teams love sharing and applying new developments that can accelerate growth.

On your first day you should expect to:
Be up and running on GitHub, TravisCI, Codecov, Sentry, and Docker
Start looking at an existing code base and sketching out a plan of attack for your project
Begin learn about how our business works to add context to your day to day work
Going forward, expect to:
Add new features to tools and services that support businesses under incubation
Streamline existing processes that are painful or time consuming
Upgrade existing systems to take advantage of new technologies
Support analysts who use your tools in production workflows
Build monitoring infrastructure that makes sure systems and campaigns are running smoothly
Maintain and improve existing libraries, APIs, and services that analyst teams and incubating companies depend on daily to grow their businesses

As our product and customer base grow, we’re seeing interesting technical challenges. We’ve recently finished:
Moving from Sprockets to Webpack/Yarn

Variety of consulting; new technologies, projects, and people on a regular basis.
Stability; we’ve been around since 1996 and have a diverse mix of clients and technologies to keep us busy, very busy. And we keep a bench. If you’re not on a project, you’re writing software for our internal business functions or you’re learning new technologies. It’s in our benefit to make our consultants as marketable as possible. That’s good for your career.
No politics or management; we don’t get in the way. Why sit in meetings all day when you can code and be productive?
Awesome benefits; free healthcare for your entire family (yes, free), 24 days of PTO + 10 days of sick time, quarterly profit-sharing bonuses, you get paid OT, company trips (to Mexico), 3 company lake cabins/homes, various quarterly company events, new MacBook Pro’s, free beer/soda, chips, candy, and so much more.
You work with the best. Do an Object Partners search on LinkedIn and see the types of talent we hire. You truly get to work with intelligent, passionate engineers that share the same goal of building great software the right way.
Low company overhead. It all means more money back into our consultant's pockets (profit sharing) or company trips and events to share in the financial success.

Qualifications
JVM service frameworks such as Spring Boot.
Reactive libraries such as RxJava, Ratpack, Reactor, Akka, and Vert.x.
Automated testing with tools such as Spock, JUnit, and Geb.

Cloud-based systems such as AWS, Google Compute Engine, Heroku, DigitalOcean.
Passion for software development. Someone that loves what they do, that aren’t just in it for a paycheck. Do you have dev projects going on at home at all times?
Aptitude for learning. New projects, new teams, new technologies mean having to adjust and learn all the time. You might get thrown on a Spring or mobile project as well, so having the ability to jump in and get your feet wet without hesitation is important. If you don’t want to grow and learn, we’re not a fit.
Positive, can-do attitude. We can teach the technology, but we can’t teach how to approach client challenges with a positive, helpful demeanor. The best consultants aren’t the most technical (although that sure helps), it’s the consultant that will do whatever it takes to see a client be successful, no matter what they throw at you."

Who are we?

We’re FarApp, a rapidly growing e-commerce automation solution company. It sounds like a lot of buzz words, but we really are growing fast and want to bring in new talented folks to help manage our rapidly expanding customer base. We hope that we can find that talent in you!

FarApp is a SAAS company who has been in business for over 15 years. In those 15 years, we’ve expanded our original codebase to over 1.5 million lines of code processing millions of operations a day. We connect to over 60 endpoints to help our customers become versatile e-commerce participants.

What will you be doing?

You’ll be diving into our code and figuring out ways to permanently solve problems that our customers either create or point out. This requires that you have a comfort with reading code in the context of a larger system without fear and that you're willing to try out and test solutions. You need to be comfortable deploying code 10 times a day into a live environment as you solve real-world problems.

You’ll also be helping to expand our product line. We add new endpoints to our service all the time, meaning that we must develop new connectors to integrate within our current system. That could mean something simple like a new logistics company, or it could be a new marketplace that has popped up that people are flocking to.

You’ll also be participating in our continuing effort to reduce our integration time. Currently, we have an average integration time for new customers of 40 days. We strongly believe we can reduce that to less than a day, maybe less than a couple of hours. We need your creative, intelligent ideas and initiative to make that happen.

We're looking for somebody who is passionate about software and is interested to start at the ground level with a company so that they can help it grow and share in its success. We hope that you're excited to make a big impact because you'll have plenty of opportunities to do that. We don't need somebody with a lot of experience but just need somebody who can learn new technologies quickly and is excited to make learning part of their regular routine.

Cool things:

Competitive salary with great benefits

Working from home! We’re evil and make you work from home two days a week!

We offer health, dental and vision plans.

We have a 401k plan.

Bi-monthly catered lunches and office snacks.

Bi-annual raises and performance-based bonuses.

Monthly company outings

Things you need (requirements):
BS Degree in Computer Science or related field
Knowledge in Python, Flask, TurboGears, AngularJS is a plus
Experience with eCommerce marketplaces and/or platforms and APIs is a plus
We're recruiting for applicants at levels of experience who are passionate about solving problems.
