Since 1868, Berkeley has fueled a perpetual renaissance, generating unparalleled intellectual, economic and social value in California, the United States and the world. Berkeley's culture of openness, freedom and acceptance—academic and artistic, political and cultural—make it a very special place for students, faculty and staff.Berkeley is committed to hiring and developing staff who want to work in a high performing culture that supports the outstanding work of our faculty and students. In deciding whether to apply for a staff position at Berkeley, candidates are strongly encouraged to consider the alignment of the Berkeley Workplace Culture with their potential for success at http://jobs.berkeley.edu/why-berkeley.html .Application Review DateThe First Review Date for this job is: Immediate ReviewDepartmental OverviewUC Berkeley is looking for a dynamic technical project manager who is interested in coordinating a program focused on transforming decision making through the use of big data, machine learning, and cloud computing. The Connected Corridors team is about to launch, in association with Caltrans, an Amazon cloud based Integrated Corridor Management (ICM) system in multiple regions across California. With the launch of the first system in 2020, the fundamental capabilities to gather, process and utilize data for traffic management will be in place. A project manager is needed to coordinate and lead the completion of the initial development phase, the deployment to multiple locations and the overall presentation of results, schedules and budgets.The job is challenging, but the rewards are substantial. There are few places with as many opportunities as UC Berkeley and, with the ongoing support of Caltrans, worthy accomplishments are possible. This is a position for an individual who is proactive, willing to accept some risk, and who understands that all things important are accomplished through teamwork and collaboration.This position will provide support in three areas: General project support, Administrative support and Liaison with other departments. The position reports to the program manager. The program has roughly 15 personnel.The candidate is responsible for coordinating the development, installation and initial operation of an advanced transportation management decision support system planned for use in multiple large urban areas within California. The effort is a high profile, multi-million dollar a year program involving a direct staff of 20 people (Engineers, Researchers, Students, Interns and Administrative staff) and numerous external vendor and stakeholder relationships. The job offers a challenging and highly rewarding position in which the candidate can lead an effort that will improve traffic congestion in California. Background and details follow.California Partners for Advanced Transportation Technology (PATH) was established in 1986. It is administered by the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), University of California, Berkeley. PATH is a multi-disciplinary program with staff, faculty and students from universities statewide. It engages in cooperative projects with private industry, state and local agencies, and non-profit institutions.PATH's mission is to develop applied solutions to the problems of California's surface transportation systems. It performs cutting edge research, develops new technologies, writes new policies, studies the priorities of our partners and accepts and manages the risk inherent in applying new ideas to complex transportation networks. PATH develops these solutions by harnessing the knowledge of transportation researchers and partnering with experts in the fields of information technology, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, economics, transportation policy and behavioral studies. It tests these solutions in the real world, adjusts and refines them, evaluates their costs and efficacy empirically, and reports and documents the results in technical, professional and public forums. It delivers complex working solutions by combing technology, human factors, policies, laws and educational strategies.The largest program within PATH is the Connected Corridors Program ( https://connected-corridors.berkeley.edu/ ). This program focuses on Integrated Corridor Management (ICM) and advanced Decision Support systems. This program is developing a unique ICM system for use by Caltrans (California Department of Transportation). An initial pilot is scheduled for delivery next year and will manage a 20 mile stretch of the I-210 in the LA Region, focusing on the communities of Pasadena, Arcadia, Monrovia, and Duarte. The system is designed to coordinate responses to incidents so that arterial streets can be effectively used as alternate routes during an incident. Plans are already underway to utilize the decision support system and associated software in Orange County and in other corridors in LA.With the Los Angeles pilot approaching delivery, Orange County expecting to start installation next year, and other locations in California soon to follow, an experienced project manager is needed to coordinate these efforts and ensure their success. It is important to note that experience in the transportation field is not a requirement for this position. Experience managing the development and installation of complex software systems is required. This program is working to bring a more analytical, data driven approach to transportation management. The position requires travel to meet with, coordinate and educate stakeholders. These trips generally require a one-night stay or are out and back in one day. The position has excellent benefits including a pension and lifetime health care once the vesting period is reached. Visa assistance may also be available.Responsibilities30% I-210 Pilot and Orange County Implementation - The position is responsible for bringing all the above responsibilities together to ensure the successful delivery of the I-210 pilot, the Orange County implementation and the fan out of the technology to the rest of California.15% Organizational and Human Coordination - The position is responsible for effectively utilizing employees, contractors and vendors in the delivery of the Connected Corridors decision support system. Please see the attached organization chart.15% Program management and scheduling - The position is responsible for creating, tracking and ensuring compliance with schedules and budgets.10% Leadership - The program is focused on changing the way traffic is managed in California. The University, as an innovative thought leader in data analytics and transportation management, was chosen to lead and implement this program. The position requires the confidence and capability to maintain this leadership position through effective communication with sponsors, stakeholders and university personnel. Leadership provides the motivation and facilitation our public sector stakeholders require to stay focused and committed to the delivery of the Connected Corridors system.10% Industry Relationship Coordination - The program works closely with our vendors who play an essential part in ensuring our success and delivering components of our system.
