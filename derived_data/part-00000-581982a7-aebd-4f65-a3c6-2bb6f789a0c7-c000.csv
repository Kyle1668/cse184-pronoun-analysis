Writings of Charles S. Peirce is a selective but comprehensive chronological and critical edition designed to document the development of Peirce’s thought in every area and promote the critical study of his intellectual growth and interdisciplinary reach. Charles S. Peirce (1839–1914) is recognized worldwide as one of humanity’s most rigorous, versatile, and seminal thinkers. The range and power of his contributions is such that he has become a stimulating influence on philosophers, humanists, social scientists, and hard scientists on every continent.A core urban campus of Indiana University, IUPUI is an EEO/AA employer with a strong commitment to diversity. We encourage a diverse applicant pool for this position.Position missionThis position is that of a web programmer and developer whose principal responsibility will be to continue and finish researching, developing, and programming an online open-source Scholarly Text-Editing Platform (STEP) that will be the principal production platform for the Peirce Edition Project (Institute for American Thought) and for many other scholarly editions in the nation and abroad. The position will receive the title of Visiting Associate Technical Editor.STEPSTEP is to reproduce online, in a cloud-based open-source implementation, the full workflow and lifecycle of the production of such editions, from transcription to critical editing, annotations, bibliographical research, and layout for print or digital output.

STEP complies with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium, an international organization that for 25 years has been setting best-practice standards for the XML encoding of scholarly texts (including transcriptive, editorial, descriptive, semantic, and linguistic encodings). STEP is designed to facilitate the daily work of all platform users: transcribers/encoders, textual editors, annotators, and scholars specializing in most disciplines of the humanities, social sciences, and the hard sciences, when the concern lies in the preservation and dissemination of essential texts.

Development success will ensure the position holder with durable marketable reputation and a strong subsequent career. The successful candidate will take the lead in many initiatives, including offering well-researched design and programming solutions to complex transcription and editorial situations, while taking into account the needs and work habits of platform users. This position will be expected to interact with HCI specialists, specific editors, and advisory board members about issues encountered during platform programming and development, and to search for solutions by seeking expert advice online, and within or outside the university.Starting salaryThis is a two-year full-time position, $69,150 on a twelve-month contract, including 38.09% fringe benefits, renewed once.
