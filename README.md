# Tech Job Posting Use of Gender-specific Pronouns Analysis

## Motivation

It's common knowledge that a majority of software engineers identify as male. Despite gains in gender diversity across other STEM professions, software engineering remains largely stagnant. There is a myriad of factors influencing this reality.

We're interested in exploring the role the wording of job postings play in potentially discouraging non-male candidates from applying. This project is inspired by Textio.
